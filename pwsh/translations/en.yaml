configuration:
  scripts:
    name: Scripts
    description: >-
      A list of filenames of scripts you wish to run at startup.
      Optionally provide a path: with trailing slash eg. /share/mynetworkshare/

  ps_modules:
    name: PowerShell Modules
    description: >-
      A list of PowerShell module names from the PowerShell Gallery to automatically
      download and install at startup. These will be automatically available to all your scripts.
      You can optionally specify a Version (e.g., '2.1.0' or '2.*') and check Prerelease
      if you want to allow downloading prerelease/beta versions.

  custom_module_paths:
    name: Custom Module Paths
    description: >-
      A list of custom folder paths (e.g., /share/my_custom_modules/) to add to the
      PowerShell environment path. This allows your scripts to automatically discover
      and import modules stored in these locations without needing to specify the full path.

  threads:
    name: Throttle/Thread Limit
    description: >-
      The thread limit for the number of jobs to be launched. Threading is
      handled automatically with jobs/scripts waiting for a slot when you want
      to run more scripts than the set Throttle Limit.
      Ensure you don't set all your scripts to run in infinite loops or some
      may never run if there are inadequate threads available.

  ondemand:
    name: On-Demand Mode
    description: >-
      Make use of the hassio.addon_stdin action in Home Assistant to run
      scripts on-demand.
      This allows you to schedule the running of scripts using Home Assistant.
